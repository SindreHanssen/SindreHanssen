Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub. 

I am just a regular teenager who's trying to get into programming, mainly Python for now, although I would love to sometime learn c++.
This is why I have made this GitHub today, 07/12/2022. 
I do have basic knowledge in both python and C#, but I would'nt say that my skills are particularly great.

As I am pushing my grades in school, the time for learning is limited, but I will try to learn as much as I can. I hope that getting this GetHub started, along with 
doing Avent of Code, will make it so that I keep persuing the art of programming. 

If you by any chance want to contact me about anything, here is my disc:
